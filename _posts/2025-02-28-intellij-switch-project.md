# Quickly Switch Between Projects in JetBrains IDEs

I often juggle multiple projects, and constantly opening and closing them can be a hassle. JetBrains IDEs offer a shortcut to quickly switch between projects, saving you time and effort, but unfortunately it's not enabled by default.

## Setting Up the Shortcut

 1. Open your JetBrains IDE and go to Settings (<kbd>âŒ˜</kbd>+<kbd>,</kbd>).
 1. Navigate to Keymap.
 1. Search for "Manage Project".
 1. Add a desired shortcut, I'm using <kbd>cmd</kbd>+<kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>M</kbd>

## Using the Shortcut

Press your shortcut key combination to open the Switcher window, displaying recent projects:

This way you can switch between opened projects, as well as closed ones!
