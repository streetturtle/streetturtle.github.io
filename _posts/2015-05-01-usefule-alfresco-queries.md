## Why you may use SQL queries

The proper way to get information about your repo would be to create a Java or javascript webscript. To get info about documents you'll need to use [CMIS](http://docs.alfresco.com/4.2/concepts/intrans-metadata-query.html) query language in it. But sometimes more convenient way is to use SQL. For example in the project I'm working on we use [AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/) for monitoring. For one of the dashboards we would like to have a document counter and for AppDynamics it's more convenient to get a result from database rather than response from an Alfresco webscript. So here we go!

First we need to connect to Alfresco database. You can refer to this post to do it: [Connect to alfresco database]({{ site.url }}/2015/02/connect-to-alfresco-db).

## Total number of documents in repository

This query will return number of nodes which have _cm:content_ type:

{% highlight sql%}
select count(*) as cm_content_nodes
from alf_node nd, alf_qname qn, alf_namespace ns
where qn.ns_id = ns.id
  and nd.type_qname_id = qn.id
  and ns.uri = 'http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0'
  and qn.local_name = 'content';
{% endhighlight sql%}

To get number of folders (which have _cm:folder_ type) replace `content` by `folder`. To see all available types run following queries:

{% highlight sql%}
select * from alf_namespace; -- namespaces
select * from alf_qname;     -- qnames
{% endhighlight sql%}

For custom types change qname and namespace.

## Document name - creator - date

This one will return human readable document name, username of creator and date when this document was created:

{% highlight sql %}
select nd.audit_creator as creator, 
       np.string_value as document_name, 
       nd.audit_created as created_on
  from alf_node as nd, alf_node_properties as np, 
       alf_namespace ns, alf_qname qn, alf_qname qn1
 where nd.id=np.node_id
   and qn.ns_id = ns.id
   and nd.type_qname_id = qn.id
   and ns.uri = 'http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0'
   and qn.local_name = 'content'
   and qn1.ns_id = ns.id
   and np.qname_id = qn1.id
   and qn1.local_name = 'name'
   and nd.audit_created > '2015-05-06 14:59:00';
{% endhighlight sql %}

Please note that it only works with `cm:content` types of document. If you did modification to the model and created some custom type, let's say `ep:content`, then you need to run this query:

{% highlight sql%}
select nd.audit_creator as creator, 
       np.string_value as document_name, 
       nd.audit_created as created_on
  from alf_node as nd, alf_node_properties as np, 
       alf_namespace ns, alf_namespace ns1, 
       alf_qname qn, alf_qname qn1
 where nd.id=np.node_id
   and qn.ns_id = ns.id
   and nd.type_qname_id = qn.id
   and ns.uri = 'http://www.mycomp.com/model/epersonnel/1.0' -- change namespace
   and qn.local_name = 'content'
   and ns1.uri = 'http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0'
   and np.qname_id = qn1.id
   and qn1.ns_id = ns1.id
   and qn1.local_name = 'name'
   and nd.audit_created > '2015-05-06 14:59:00';
{% endhighlight sql%}

## Number of uploaded documents per person

This query returns list of users and number of documents uploaded by them:

{% highlight sql%}
select audit_creator as uploaded_by, count(*) as doc_uploads
  from alf_node nd, alf_qname qn, alf_namespace ns
 where qn.ns_id = ns.id
   and nd.type_qname_id = qn.id
   and ns.uri = 'http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0'
   and qn.local_name = 'content'
 group by audit_creator;
{% endhighlight sql%}

## Number of users

Total number of nodes with type `person` which is basically number of users:

{% highlight sql%}
select count(*)
  from alf_node nd, alf_qname qn
 where nd.type_qname_id = qn.id
   and qn.local_name = 'person';
{% endhighlight sql%}

## List of users

This query returns list of users from the Alfresco database:

{% highlight sql %}
select np1.string_value as first_name, 
       np2.string_value as last_name, 
       np3.string_value as username
  from alf_node_properties np1, 
       alf_node_properties np2, 
       alf_node_properties np3
 where np1.qname_id in (select id from alf_qname where local_name in ('firstName'))
   and np2.qname_id in (select id from alf_qname where local_name in ('lastName'))
   and np3.qname_id in (select id from alf_qname where local_name in ('userName'))
   and np1.node_id = np2.node_id and np1.node_id = np3.node_id
 order by 1;
{% endhighlight sql %}

## Get node's properties

{% highlight sql %}
with tt as (
    select
      node_id,
      boolean_value,
      coalesce(string_value,
               case
                 when long_value != 0 then cast(long_value as TEXT)
                 when float_value != 0 then cast(float_value as TEXT)
                 when double_value != 0 then cast(double_value as TEXT)
               end) as value,
      ns.uri as namespace,
      qn.local_name as qname
    from
      alf_node_properties np,
      alf_qname qn,
      alf_namespace ns
    where np.qname_id =  qn.id
      and qn.ns_id = ns.id)
select * from tt
 where qname = 'name'
   and namespace = 'http://www.alfresco.org/model/content/1.0'
   and VALUE = 'Document name';
 where node_id = 19304; -- by node id
{% endhighlight sql %}

More queries are coming! Stay tuned =)
