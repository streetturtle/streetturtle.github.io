   summary: I take part in the development of business critical eFiles document management system based on open source solution - Alfresco – the market leader in records management. One of my projects is eFiles – CMS system. I work in a small team of three; development is performed using agile software development with Scrum. As an Alfresco developer I work on extending and customizing Alfresco, which is needed since out of the box solutions of Alfresco do not provide enough functionality for CERN needs. Through this project, I have learned business processes of other teams, as we constantly work with CERN HR team, developing the way to link their needs with technical abilities of Alfresco software.
   accomplishments:
    - accomplishment: Customization of server-side and client-side parts of Alfresco in correspondence to the organisation's internal processes and requirements.
    - accomplishment: Integrating Alfresco with AppDynamics - application performance management system. This project consisted of setting up the AppDynamics and development of the monitoring extensions in order to provide metrics.
    - accomplishment: Development of the web application for 2nd/3rd support of eFiles. Technology stack is Spring Boot, AngularJS, Spring Data Rest.
    - accomplishment: Development of the custom user interface of Alfresco document library page based on Polymer.

   summary: I worked in GS-AIS-EB (Electronic Business) section for EDH (Electronic Document Handling) system, which covers many life aspects at CERN (such as absences, HR & Training, purchasing, logistics and safety). In this role, I was developing EDH documents and improving functionality of existing ones. I worked in a team of 8-10 people; agile software development with Scrum was used for a development performance. One of the biggest and the most interesting project during this period was the development of CERN Hotel booking application. This activity included the work with Micros/Oracle consultant and Hotel’s representatives.

Main feature developed is the possibility to create a Waiting-List reservations in cases when no rooms were available for the given period, which was not supported by Fidelio. I was working closely with customers from Hotel as well as consultant from Micros/Oracle.
