## ...me

I'm a professional software developer. I started my career as **Java Developer** at [CERN](http://home.cern/about) - the largest particle physics laboratory in the world and the birthplace of the World Wide Web :) after working there for almost 4 years I moved to Canada, Montreal where I am currently working as a **Java Consultant** at [Savoir Faire Linux](https://www.savoirfairelinux.com/en/).
My scope of interest is Java and Java related technologies, Linux, Alfresco.
