      <h4><em>September 2014 – Current</em></h4>
    </div>

    <p>I take part in the development of business critical <b>eFiles document management</b> system based on open source solution - Alfresco – the market leader in records management. One of my projects is <b>e-Personnel</b> – CMS system. I work in a small <b>team of three</b>; development is performed using agile software development with Scrum. As an Alfresco developer I work on extending and customizing Alfresco, which is needed since out of the box solutions of Alfresco do not provide enough functionality for CERN needs. Through this project, I have learned business processes of other teams, as we constantly work with CERN HR team, developing the way to link their needs with technical abilities of Alfresco software.</p>
    <p><strong>Selected Accomplishments</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Customization of server-side and client-side parts of Alfresco in correspondence to the organisation's internal processes and requirements.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Integrating Alfresco with AppDynamics - application performance management system. This project consisted of setting up the AppDynamics and development of the monitoring extensions in order to provide metrics.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      <h4><em>October 2012 – September 2014</em></h4>
    </div>
    <p>I worked in GS-AIS-EB (Electronic Business) section for EDH (<b>Electronic Document Handling</b>) system, which covers many life aspects at CERN (such as absences, HR & Training, purchasing, logistics and safety). In this role, I was <b>developing EDH documents</b> and improving functionality of existing ones. I worked in a team of <b>8-10 people</b>; agile software development with Scrum was used for a development performance. One of the biggest and the most interesting project during this period was the development of CERN Hotel booking application. This activity included the work with Micros/Oracle consultant and Hotel’s representatives.</p>
    <p><strong>Selected Accomplishments</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Migrating existing business processes from BPEL to BPMN.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Modification of the Phone Request document in order to get the possibility to choose LYNC phone.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Extending functionality of CERN Hotel web booking application (<a href="[http://hostel.cern.ch/">hostel.cern.ch</a>). Main feature developed is the possibility to create a Waiting-List reservations in cases when no rooms were available for the given period, which was not supported by Fidelio. I was working closely with customers from Hotel as well as consultant from Micros/Oracle.</p>
